# flash-live-system

Flash a Linux SBC — locally on the device itself or over the network. Transfers a disk image, overwrites the boot device, and reboots into the new image.

## Prerequisites

The script embeds a statically-linked busybox (arm64), so the target device does not need busybox, dd, xzcat, or zcat installed.

**Local mode (default — on the device itself):**
- Root access (run with `sudo`)
- `findmnt`, `lsblk`, `base64` (coreutils — present by default on Debian/RPi OS)
- Ramfs mode: enough RAM in `/dev/shm` to hold the compressed image
- Stream mode: image must be on a different block device than the one being flashed

**Remote mode (dev machine):**
- `ssh`, `scp`
- `xzcat` / `zcat` (for compressed images, stream mode only)
- `openssl` (only if using `password` in config)
- `python3` (only if using `wifi-ssid` in config)

**Remote mode (target device):**
- SSH access
- Linux with `systemd`, `findmnt`, `lsblk`
- Ramfs mode: enough RAM in `/dev/shm` to hold the compressed image (~4 GB+ devices)

## Installation

### From GitHub Releases (recommended)

Download the pre-built script with embedded busybox:

```bash
curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/flash-live-system \
  https://github.com/hatlabs/flash-live-system/releases/latest/download/flash-live-system
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/flash-live-system
```

### Building from source

Requires Docker (for cross-platform busybox extraction):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hatlabs/flash-live-system.git
cd flash-live-system
./run build
# Output: dist/flash-live-system
```

## Usage

```bash
# Local (default — on the device itself, auto-detects best mode)
sudo flash-live-system [--ramfs|--stream] [--config FILE] <image>

# Remote (over SSH)
flash-live-system --remote <host> [--ramfs|--stream] [--config FILE] <image>
```

Supported image formats: `.img`, `.img.xz`, `.img.gz`

### First-boot customization

Use `--config FILE` to pre-configure the flashed image via cloud-init. The config file uses simple `key=value` format — see `example.conf` for all available keys.

```bash
# Flash with customization
sudo flash-live-system --config myboat.conf image.img.xz

# Remote with customization
flash-live-system --remote halos.local --config myboat.conf image.img.xz
```

Config file format:

```ini
# myboat.conf
hostname=myboat
user=mairas
password=secret123
ssh-key=~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
ssh-key=~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
wifi-ssid=MyNetwork
wifi-password=MyPass
wifi-country=FI
```

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `hostname` | Set system hostname |
| `user` | Set username (replaces default 'pi') |
| `password` | Set user password (hashed locally with `openssl passwd -6`) |
| `ssh-key` | SSH public key file (repeatable; defaults to `~/.ssh/*.pub` if `user` is set) |
| `wifi-ssid` | WiFi network name (requires `wifi-password`) |
| `wifi-password` | WiFi password (requires `wifi-ssid`) |
| `wifi-country` | WiFi regulatory domain (default: `GB`) |

Tilde (`~/`) in `ssh-key` paths is expanded automatically. The `ssh-key` key can appear multiple times to add multiple keys.

### Confirmation prompt

Before flashing, the tool requires you to type a target-specific phrase to confirm:

```
Type "nuke halos.local from orbit" to proceed:
```

For local mode, the phrase uses `localhost` as the target.

For scripted/CI usage, pass both `--yes` and `--yes-i-really-mean-it` to skip the prompt:

```bash
sudo flash-live-system --yes --yes-i-really-mean-it image.img.xz
```

Using only `--yes` without `--yes-i-really-mean-it` is an error — both flags are required together to prevent accidental bypasses.

After `dd` completes, the helper mounts the boot partition (FAT32, partition 1) and writes `user-data` and/or `network-config` files for cloud-init. If no config file is given, behavior is identical to a plain flash.

**Important:** Customization assumes the new image has a FAT32 boot partition as partition 1. After `dd`, the helper parses the new partition table via `busybox fdisk` and loop-mounts at the correct offset, so the new image's partition layout does not need to match the old one. However, if the new image lacks a FAT32 boot partition, customization will fail (the flash itself still succeeds and the device reboots normally).

### Local mode (default)

Runs directly on the device being flashed, without SSH. The script **auto-detects** the best flash method:
1. If `/dev/shm` has enough space for the image → uses **ramfs** (safe for same-disk images)
2. If `/dev/shm` is too small but the image is on a **different disk** → uses **stream**
3. If `/dev/shm` is too small and the image is on the **same disk** → fails with an error

You can override auto-detection with `--ramfs` or `--stream`.

```bash
# Auto-detect best mode (recommended)
sudo flash-live-system image.img.xz

# Force ramfs (e.g., you know there's enough /dev/shm)
sudo flash-live-system --ramfs image.img.xz

# Force stream from USB drive
sudo flash-live-system --stream /mnt/usb/image.img.xz

# With first-boot customization
sudo flash-live-system --config myboat.conf image.img.xz
```

### Remote mode

Use `--remote <host>` to flash a device over SSH. Defaults to ramfs mode.

```bash
# Remote ramfs (default)
flash-live-system --remote halos.local ~/images/halos-marine.img.xz

# Remote stream
flash-live-system --remote pi@192.168.1.100 --stream image.img.xz
```

### Ramfs mode (default)

Copies the compressed image to the target's `/dev/shm` (via `cp` locally, or scp remotely), then decompresses and writes it. This is the safest mode — if the transfer fails, no destructive action has happened.

### Stream mode

Decompresses and pipes the image directly to `dd`. In remote mode, the stream goes over SSH. In local mode, the image must be on a different block device (e.g., USB stick) — a safety check prevents streaming from the disk being flashed.

## How it works

### Key design decisions

- **Ramfs mode is default**: scp/cp provides a pre-flash integrity check (file size verification). If the transfer fails, no destructive action has happened — the device is fully recoverable.
- **Stream mode uses SSH as transport** (remote): The decompressed image is piped directly through SSH (`xzcat | ssh host "dd ..."`). SSH handles flow control, buffering, and connection lifecycle correctly. When xzcat finishes, SSH sends EOF, dd gets EOF and exits. No nc/ncat needed.
- **No pivot_root or unmount**: `dd` writes to the raw block device, bypassing the mounted filesystem. `reboot -f` skips sync so the old filesystem cache doesn't write back.
- **Embedded static busybox**: The script embeds a statically-linked busybox binary (arm64, Debian). At runtime it's extracted to `/dev/shm` and used for all target-side operations (`dd`, `xzcat`, `reboot`, etc.). This eliminates shared library dependencies and the need for any tools on the target beyond SSH and basic Linux utilities.
- **EXIT trap (stream mode)**: The helper uses `trap 'busybox reboot -f' EXIT` to ensure reboot happens even if the SSH session drops during or after the write.
- **Config file over flags**: Passwords stay in a file (not visible in `ps` or shell history), and settings are written once and reused across flashes.

## Choosing a mode

| | Local ramfs | Local stream | Remote ramfs (default) | Remote stream |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Safety** | Pre-flash integrity check | Requires image on separate disk | Pre-flash integrity check | Transfer failure = partial image |
| **Progress** | cp progress (if terminal) | None (dd reports at end) | scp progress bar | None (dd reports at end) |
| **RAM required** | Compressed image in /dev/shm | Minimal | Compressed image in /dev/shm | Minimal |
| **Speed** | Fast | Fast (local I/O only) | Fast (local decompress + NVMe) | Network-bound |
| **Needs SSH** | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Needs root** | Yes | Yes | No (sudo on target) | No (sudo on target) |

In local mode (default), the script auto-detects the best mode, so you typically don't need to specify `--ramfs` or `--stream`. Use `--remote <host>` for devices you can reach over SSH — use `--stream` for remote devices with less than ~4 GB RAM where the compressed image won't fit in `/dev/shm`.

## Limitations

- **Stream mode (remote)**: If the transfer fails mid-stream, the device has a partial image and may need manual re-flash.
- **Local stream mode**: The image file must be on a different block device than the one being flashed. Use local ramfs mode if the image is on the same disk.
- The helper script stops `container-*`, `marine-*`, `halos-*`, `cockpit`, and `docker` services. Adjust if your target runs different services.
- The embedded busybox is arm64 only. x86 targets are not supported.
- Only tested with Raspberry Pi (HaLOS) but should work on any arm64 Linux SBC with the listed prerequisites.
